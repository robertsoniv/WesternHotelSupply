            <p><b>*Please Note:</b> Merchandise that has been used or damaged is no longer in new and ready-to-sell condition and should not be returned and cannot be refunded, replaced or exchanged unless it has a manufacturer defect or was damaged in shipping. All returned merchandise must be in its original packaging, including all parts and paperwork. Customized, personalized and made to order products are not returnable for any reason besides a manufacturing defect.</p>
            <p>Our Customer Service Department is available to help you return merchandise Monday - Thursday, 7am to 6pm CST and Friday 8am-5pm CST at 1-800-645-3856. You can also process your return anytime by completing our <a href="">Online Merchandise Return Request Form</a></p>
            <h3>Custom/ Made-to-Order Products:</h3>
            <p>Customize, personalized and made to order products are not returnable for any reason besides a manufacturing defect.</p>
            <h3>Returning items? Just follow these instructions:</h3>
            <p>Notify us by completing an Online Merchandise Return Request Form or contacting our friendly Customer Service Department.</p>
            <p>You will be issued a Return Authorization Number (RA#) and provided with return instructions on what to do next in accordance with our Return Policy within 24-48 hours upon receipt of your Return Merchandise Request. (Excludes: Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays).</p>
            <p>Properly package your return merchandise to avoid damages. Please include all original packaging, parts and paperwork.</p>
            <h3>Why Do I Need an RA Number?</h3>
            <p><b>This is necessary for:</b></p>
            <p>1. <em>Identification of your returned merchandise.</em> Our warehouses receive hundreds of packages every day. Without an RA number (Return Authorization Number) identifying it, your package may become lost.</p>
            <p>2. <em>Returning your package to the right warehouse.</em> We have multiple warehouses throughout the United States that we ship from so you receive your order as fast as possible. Returned merchandise must be sent back to the proper location. Shipping a return to the wrong warehouse or our mailing address will significantly delay the processing of your return and may result in additional fees or the loss of your package. We are not responsible for lost packages.</p>
            <p>3. <em>Avoiding lost returns.</em> Without a proper RA number and Tracking number, your package can easily get lost; identifying a lost package is almost impossible. If we do not receive or cannot find your package, we cannot process your return.</p>
            <h3>My Order Was Damaged in Shipping</h3>
            <p>If your order arrives with obvious damage and you refuse the shipment, please notify us immediately by contacting our Customer Service Department. We will make arrangements to ship a replacement as soon as possible. If you discover that your order was damaged after receiving it, please complete an Online Merchandise Return Request Form. You will be issued a Case ID Number (CR#) and we will provide you with instructions on what to do next in accordance with our return policy. Arrangements to ship a replacement will be made as soon as possible. In the meantime, please prepare the damaged merchandise for pickup. In most cases, the carrier that shipped the merchandise (usually UPS/FedEx) will be by to pick it up for inspection. Please keep a copy of the pickup tracking number, should you need it for future reference. This is your proof that the carrier picked up the merchandise for shipping damage inspection.</p>
            <p><b>Please Note:</b> Providing photos of the damaged box and item will help speed up the claim process tremendously.</p>
            <h3>My Order Was Lost in Transit</h3>
            <p>In the event that you do not receive your merchandise because it has been lost in transit, please notify us immediately by contacting our Customer Service Department. We will work with the carrier to find and deliver your order. In most cases, the carrier (usually UPS/FedEx) will find and deliver your package in 1-2 business days. Of course, we will make arrangements to ship a replacement when needed.</p>
            <h3>There Was an Error in My Order</h3>
            <p>Although it rarely happens, in the case your order arrives with an error (i.e., what you received is not what you ordered) or is defective, please notify us by completing an Online Merchandise Return Request Form. You will be issued a Case ID Number (CR#) and given instructions for what to do next.</p>
            <h3>Refunds/Replacements</h3>
            <p>1. If you are returning your merchandise and would like a refund, your credit card or account will be refunded the original purchase price (plus sales tax if applicable) once the returned merchandise is received back in our warehouse. </p>
